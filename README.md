## 1. Oxford 102 flowers dataset
- https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/
- if you have a pre-selected model for your task, please take it. And you can use it to train your model. (e.g., resnet)
- if you don't have a pre-selected model, very likely you won't get a good result.



### 2. Fatigue check
- 5 face or 68 face points
